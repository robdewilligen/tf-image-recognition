# Tensorflow Image Recognition script

# Results:
Iteration 1: without manipulation:  
Goal: Create a model capable of prediction on a split dataset
- accuracy: 0.9635, validation_accuracy: 0.6376  

Iteration 2: with data augmentation (flip, rotate and zoom)
Goal: Improve the accuracy of the model by introducing more data by augmenting the available images
- accuracy: 0.7683, validation_accuracy: 0.7439
